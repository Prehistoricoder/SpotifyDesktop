SpotifyDesktop
==============

This is a simple Windows desktop application that works with the Spotify desktop client to show the currently playing song and album art on the desktop.  There are no player controls, it's purely an eye-candy type of application (and I like being able to quickly glance down and see the title of a song I like).

Binaries will soon be available at http://www.ericr.org/projects/SpotifyDesktop.

Please feel free to use or modify the code in any way you see fit.  All I ask is that you update the last.fm API key if you re-release this application under your own name.

## How to Use

To use the application, just run it.  It will look for a running Spotify instance and attach itself to it.  To close the app, right-click on the album art.

## Requirements

* You need to have the Spotify desktop application installed, of course.  And a Spotify account (I think?  I don't think the client can be used to play local collections, but I could be wrong)
* .NET Framework 4.5.1 or later  (link here:  http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=42643)
* This application was developed for .NET 4.5 using Visual Studio 2013.
